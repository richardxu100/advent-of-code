# Day 2 Notes

## Notes
* So to make things safe, we could do the slow approach, of just removing one from a list, and re-running the safe check???
* For a line of 10 elements, that would require 10 iterations

* Can we limit this, so we can know beforehand if a level may be almost safe? 
* Let's try slow approach for now, as it's not that much slower. It goes from N to around n^2
